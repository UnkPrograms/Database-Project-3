# Database-Project-3
Third Project of Database in Spring 2017 UofA

NOTES:
1. The programs were ran and tested on linux machines.
2. Prog3 and SQLConvert were written in Java using the Eclipse IDE
3. The program will not successfully run unless you have your own oracle account. In that case, in line 87 and 88 of Prog3.java, you will have to put your oracle username and password.

Purpose and Description:
Basically takes the AIMS files for schools in Arizona and stores the information into an Oracle Database. Then the Program can be run to inquire questions about schools from the AIMS data by talking to the database using SQL

How to Run SQLConvert:
1. Use the command 'make' or 'make all'
2. Use the command 'java SQLConvert'
3. This creates .sql files in which you can execute to create and insert data into your Oracle database (or likewise copy and paste the SQL statements)

How to Run Prog3
1. Use the command 'java Prog3'
2. After hitting any key to continue, the user will be prompted to select choices from a menu using integers
3. From the available options, appropriate data and information will be displayed.
